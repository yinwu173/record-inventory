# Employee Payroll Tracker

 ## Description About the Project

 * For this project, it aims to track employee payroll so that the payroll manager can properly budget for the company.

 ## Acceptance Criteria

 * It is done when the user is presented with a series of prompts asking for the first name, last name, and salary of the employee after clicking the "Add employee" button.

 * It is done when the user is prompted to continue or cancel after finishing adding an employee.

 * It is done when the user is prompted to add a new employee when the user chooses to continue.

 * It is done when the employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data when the user chooses to cancel.

 ### Hints 

 * Add a while loop so the user can choose to continue to add another employee.

 * If the user chooses not to continue adding employees, we should set an if statement and declare the function as false so that it would return and end the function.

 * To randomly select an employee, we should use Math.random. This method will generate a random index from the employees array.
